                  This page is where all the opinion peices you favourited will be saved to.
                  We have added this page to allow you to find your favourite opinions more
                  easily, without having to sift through facts and references. Remember, these
                  are the highly sophisicated and educated opinions of researches who totally
                  know what they are taling about. If you have any questions or comments you
                  want to make to the creaters of these quotes, go back to the blog-brary page
                  and look up their email. Usually they don't respond, so I wouldn't get your
                  hopes up. Also, if you are going to message the writers of your favourite
                  quotes, make sure to give us suggestions on what animals you want them to
                  give their opinion on next time they have the chance to write a peice!
