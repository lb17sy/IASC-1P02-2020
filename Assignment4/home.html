                <h2 id="Welcome">Welcome to our Animal Research Website!</h2>
                <p>
                  Have you ever wanted to learn about an animal you really like ore have wanted to find other opinions on
                  animals that you think are really cool, but are just unable to find any opinion pieces? Well, your
                  countless days spent browsing for such content is over, because we here at Favourite Animal Discovery aim
                  to give you opinion pieces on a wide range of animals that you maybe might have not even heard of! For
                  this very task we have a team (consisting of one person) who has dedicated their time into researching
                  various animals in order to help you viewers find like-minded opinions or even to learn new perspectives
                  on creatures from all across the animal Kingdom.
                </p>

                <h2 id="Qualified">How are our Researchers Qualified for the Job?</h2>
                <p>
                  That’s the best part... we're not qualified by any professional standards for this task that we are taking on!

                  …

                  Wait, don’t leave, hear me out.

                  We may not have any professional/academic titles or certifications that prove that we are capable of
                  providing high-level education on these topics, but out researcher(s) spend hours upon hours watching
                  documentaries, YouTube videos, and just walking outside to observe wildlife around them! It is for this
                  reason that we believe that their expertise (along with the help of Wikipedia) will be more than enough
                  to satisfy your desire to learn more about the animals you love!
                </p>

                <h2 id="Kinds">What kinds of animals can you expect to see on this list?</h2>
                <p>
                  You can expect to see animals from many different animal families and species. There will be no shortage
                  of animals to find on this list (hopefully). For example, here are a few places the animals you will see
                  might be from:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Canada</li>
                  <li>America</li>
                  <li>Kenya</li>
                  <li>Taiwan</li>
                  <li>Russia</li>
                  <li>Brazil</li>
                  <li>Etc.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  As you can see, there are many places that the animals on this website will originate from. We hope that
                  this diverse selection will allow you to be find opinions on animals that you agree with without
                  difficulty.
                </p>

                <h2 id="Real">Is this a Real Website?</h2>

                <p>
                  Well, the website is real in the sense that it exists, but it is not managed or financed by any
                  large cooperation. This website is maintained entirely by the researcher(s) that provide the opinion
                  pieces. Before you ask (because of course you wanted to ask), we do NOT have any method of
                  allowing our viewers to contribute to our research by donation. Noone who is involved with our
                  website will ask you to donate money or to provide any banking information. If someone does reach
                  out to you asking for such things...well.... just don’t give them money. We have no legal
                  responsibility for any money lost due to scams, and therefore will not be obligated to provide
                  aid in tracking down the criminal. Unless we feel like it. Usually, we don’t feel like it.
                </p>

                <h2 id="Contact">How can we contact researchers?</h2>

                <p>
                  Every opinion article in the blog-brary will have the contact information for the researcher who
                  wrote the piece. If you feel that there is an issue with one of the opinion pieces written by a
                  researcher, you can contact them that way.
