		<h2 id="par1">Joe from down the street</h2>
    <p>
			When I got back home from school my Mom was cooking in the kitchen and said "Joe" was here
			to see me. Clearly confused, I asked who Joe was. She paused what she was doing for a moment
			and let out a chuckle before turning to me and saying in a mocking tone, "Joe? You know, the
			Joe from down the street? the one you've only known since <strong>forth grade</strong>?" I laughed it off and
		 	acted like I never asked that question, and then I asked her where 'Joe' is now. She said he
			was probably in my room playing with Suzie, my cat. Before I walked away she added "You know
			how much he loves that cat." I walked off towards my room with my mind in a frenzy.
			Everything about that conversation felt so....<em>unnatural</em>. There is a guy in town my age named Joseph.
			Can't remember his last name but he lives down the street from me and we're in the same class. Well, I assume we are,
			since he's on the attendance list; but he did miss the first class of school today so I thought
			he might have transferred to another school last minute. We've never spoken to Joseph, how is my mom
			so comfortable with letting him into the house and leaving him in my room alone? And that
			face she made when I asked why he was in the house...that puzzled look that made it seem like she
			was wondering the same thing before it snapped to an expression of "Oh that's right, I remember
			who that is." Even though it was short, that conversation made it clear that something was wrong
			with Mom, and I don't think she realizes it.
		</p>
		<h2 id="par2">My friend Joe</h2>
    <p>
			I walked upstairs and looked down at the hallway where light was coming through my room door.
			Someone was definitely in there. I walked down the hall and hesitantly stepped into the doorframe,
			and there he was, laying down on my room floor while petting the cat, obviously making himself at
			home. He noticed me stepping through the door and his eyes lit up, like he was seeing an old friend.
			"Barly you're back!" he said with an excited voice just before a frown suddenly replace the excited
		 	look he had. "Oh...you don't remember me, do you?" I confirmed that I did not know him, and he looked
			toward Suzie with the excited look in his eyes fading away. "That's alright, maybe next time."
			I asked him what he was doing in my house, and he responded with "You let me stay here." I responded
			by asking him why I would let a stranger stay in my house, and trust him so much as to let him stay
			in my room unsupervised. Joe just shrugged and continued to pet Suzie. I began to fee irritated and
			was just about ready to throw him out and I began walking towards him. Before I reached him he pointed
		 	towards a picture frame on my dresser of me in forth grade standing with my town's local soccer team.
			I took a closer look and saw someone that looked like a younger version of Joesph. <strong>Oh. That's right.</strong>
			I remember Joe. He's my <em>best friend</em>. I turned back to Joe and gave him a hug telling him how
		 	sorry I was for not remembering. He said he didn't care but his facial expressions said otherwise.
			He looked angry, but I don't blame him. After all, I did break my promise.
		</p>
		<h2 id="par3">Our situation</h2>
		<p>
			<strong>Joe</strong> is my best friend. Has been for many years now. We first met back in fourth grade when we were place
			on the same soccer team. We've hung out together, joined the same friend groups, worked on science
			projects together, and explored the mysteries of our town together ever since we were little. Recently,
			one of the newer mysteries we discovered about our town was that for some reason my house holds onto
			memories. There's a long story about some device we foud in town that we brought home which
			caused all this but it's not really worth mentioning since the device is long gone now. Anyways, this device
			had some affect on Joe and made anyone outside of our house gradually forget about him. He's not immune
			to this effect, and will even start forgetting himself if he leaves the house, which is why he's been staying
			at my place ever since the incident happened. It's also the reason why I'm the one who has to go out and look
			for ways to fix this (<em>since I'll remember him after I get back home anyway</em>).
			Sometimes my mom takes out the trash or does some other thing that requires her to go outside, and Joe says that
			that she forgets about him sometimes so he has to hide until she remembers enough about him again.
			"Any progress this time?" Joe asked me. This was a familiar question, one that he would ask everyday despite
			knowing the answer already. Like every other time he asked, I said no and that I ended up forgeting.
			"That's all right, I'm sure you'll find a way to fix this." I felt guilty. I promised him that I would find a way
			to fix this, but it's been months, and every time I go out I end up forgetting him before I can even figure out anything.
		</p>
		<h2 id="par4">A fruitless effort</h2>
		<p>
			We spend the night thinking of strategies for where I should go next, who I should talk to to find clues
			and what I could do to improve my search. The next morning I got ready to go to school, and said goodbye
			to Joe while making the same promise I make every morning. That I'll find out how to <em>fix this problem</em>.
			So I went to school looking for clues and implementing the strategies I came up with last night. I'm not sure
			what the point of asking people all these questions were, but I had a strong feeling it was important.
			By the end of the day I couldn't really recall what the point of all this was so I went home right after school
			instead of checking out that storage facility on the edge of town. I couldn't remember why I needed to go there,
			so it probably wasn't important anyways. I walked up to my front door and could already smell my mom's cooking.
			Whatever it was I needed to do I decided that it would be best to <strong>figure it out tomorrow</strong>.
